# Python Web Application Development

## Framework Choice

For this project, Flask was chosen as the web framework due to its simplicity, flexibility, and lightweight nature. Flask is well-suited for small to medium-sized web applications and provides enough freedom to structure the project as needed without imposing too much boilerplate code. This makes it perfect for a straightforward application like displaying the current time in Moscow.

## Best Practices Applied

Several best practices have been applied in the development of this web application to ensure code quality, maintainability, and performance:

- **Code Organization**: The project structure is kept simple yet effective, with a clear separation between the application logic (`app.py`) and the documentation (`PYTHON.md` and `README.md`).
- **PEP 8 Compliance**: The code follows PEP 8 style guidelines, ensuring readability and consistency throughout the application.
- **Timezone Management**: The `pytz` library is used for accurate timezone conversions, ensuring the displayed time is always correct for Moscow.

## Testing

The application was manually tested to confirm that the current time updates upon page refreshing. Automated testing could be implemented in future iterations to further ensure the application's reliability through continuous integration practices.
