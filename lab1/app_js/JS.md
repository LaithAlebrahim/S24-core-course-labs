# JavaScript Web Application Development with Express

## Framework Choice

For this project, Express.js was chosen as the web framework. Because this project requires simplicity, speed, and scalability.
## Best Practices Applied

Several best practices have been applied in the development of this web application to ensure code quality, maintainability, and performance:

- **Modular Code**: The application is structured in a way that keeps the route management simple and straightforward, facilitating easy expansion in the future.
- **Dependency Management**: The `package.json` file is used to manage project dependencies effectively, ensuring that the application environment is easily reproducible.
- **Error Handling**: Express's default error handling mechanism is utilized to manage and respond to HTTP requests that may result in errors, ensuring a robust application.

## Future Improvements

While the current application meets the basic requirements, future improvements could include:

- Implementing a more complex frontend using templating engines supported by Express, like Pug or EJS, to enhance the user interface.
- Adding a database to store quotes and user-generated content, providing dynamic content delivery.
- Implementing user authentication to create a personalized experience.
