# Docker Best Practices for App_Python

This document elaborates on the Docker best practices employed in the Dockerfile for the Flask-based web application designed to display the current time in Moscow. These practices are aimed at optimizing the build process, ensuring security, and enhancing the overall efficiency of the container.

## Utilizing an Official, Lightweight Base Image

```bash
FROM python:3.9-slim
```
**Practice** : Choosing an official Python image ensures a reliable and secure foundation. The slim variant minimizes the footprint of the image, reducing potential attack surfaces and speeding up build and deployment times.

## Working Directory
```bash
WORKDIR /app_python
```
**Practice** : Setting a specific working directory (/app_python) within the container provides a clear, consistent location for the application code, simplifying navigation and command execution within the container.

## Copying Only Necessary Files
```bash
COPY requirements.txt app.py /app_python/
COPY templates/ /app_python/templates/
```
**Practice** : By selectively copying only the files necessary for the application to run (requirements.txt, app.py, and the templates directory), we minimize the image size and reduce build time. This approach also limits the potential inclusion of sensitive files or unnecessary data in the image.

## Non-Root User
```bash
RUN adduser --disabled-password appuser && chmod -R a-w+x+r /app_python
USER appuser
```
**Practice** : Running the application as a non-root user (appuser) significantly enhances the security of the container by restricting the privileges of potential attackers, thus adhering to the principle of least privilege.

## Efficient Dependency Installation
```bash
RUN pip3 install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

```
**Practice** : Installing Python dependencies without cache (--no-cache-dir) reduces the layer size, leading to a smaller Docker image. This practice also aligns with security principles by avoiding unnecessary files that might not be needed for running the application.
## Exposing Only Necessary Port
```bash
EXPOSE 5000
```
**Practice** :Exposing only the necessary port (5000) for the Flask application follows the security best practice of minimizing the container's attack surface. It also provides clear documentation about which port the container expects to communicate on.
## Clean, Specific Startup Command
```bash
CMD ["python3", "-m", "flask", "run", "--host=0.0.0.0"]

```
**Practice** : A clear and specific command to start the Flask application ensures that the container runs predictably and is easily debuggable. Using the array syntax for CMD ensures that the command is executed without a shell, which is both more secure and allows signals like SIGTERM to be directly received by the process.
