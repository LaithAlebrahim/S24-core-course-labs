## Continuous Integration Best Practices

### Efficient Workflow Execution
- **Parallelization**: Break down tasks into concurrent jobs to improve resource usage and decrease total runtime.
- **Caching Dependencies**: Cache dependencies and Docker layers to avoid unnecessary reinstalls and rebuilds, speeding up the workflow.
- **Use Latest Actions**: Employ the most recent GitHub Actions to access new features and important security fixes.

### Security and Maintenance
- **Secure Secrets**: Store sensitive data like `SNYK_TOKEN`, `DOCKERHUB_USERNAME`, and `DOCKERHUB_TOKEN` in GitHub Secrets to protect them.
- **Specify Working Directories**: Define the execution directory for steps using the `working-directory` key to maintain clarity.
- **Conditional Docker Pushes**: Configure the workflow to push Docker images exclusively when triggered by a version tag.

### Quality and Security Assurance
- **Snyk Security Scans**: Include Snyk scans within your workflow for automatic vulnerability detection.
- **Code Quality**: Incorporate a `flake8` linting step to ensure code quality remains high.
- **Docker Buildx**: Utilize Docker buildx for effective multi-platform image builds.

### Workflow Optimization
- **Triggering Workflows**: Set the workflow to trigger on every push to maintain continuous integration and immediate feedback.
